# Weekly Reading Group at DSG

This repository hosts a list of research papers and topics that we discuss on every Saturday in the group. We believe that reading research papers not only strengthens our concepts, but also helps in understanding the intuition behind the 
development of a particular idea, and the complete thought process of the author.

A collection of concise write-ups on each paper, with something noteworthy is also maintained here.
